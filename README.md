## 🔧 Project Workflow

This project was carried out in the following steps:

1. **Database Ingestion & SQL Analysis**

   * Performed complex SQL queries to clean, join, and create an **aggregated summary table** for further analysis

2. **Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)**

   * Used pandas and NumPy for data exploration, cleaning, and handling missing/inconsistent data
   * Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand patterns and trends

3. **Business Questions & Insights**

   * Addressed key research questions aligned with business goals
   * Compared vendor performance, pricing strategies, and inventory dynamics

4. **Data Visualization (Python & Power BI)**

   * Created insightful charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
   * Built a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize KPIs and highlight actionable insights

5. **Reporting**

   * Compiled a structured report summarizing findings, interpretations, and business recommendations
   🔏Report is private due to dataset licensing restrictions.

## ✨Final Recommendations 
* 🔷Re-evaluate pricing for low-sales, high-margin brands to boost sales 
volume without sacrificing profitability. 
* 🔷Diversify vendor partnerships to reduce dependency on a few 
suppliers and mitigate supply chain risks. 
* 🔷Leverage bulk purchasing advantages to maintain competitive pricing 
while optimizing inventory management. 
* 🔷Optimize slow-moving inventory by adjusting purchase quantities, 
launching clearance sales, or revising storage strategies. 
* 🔷Enhance marketing and distribution strategies for low-performing 
vendors to drive higher sales volumes without compromising profit 
margins. 
* 🔷By implementing these recommendations, the company can achieve 
sustainable profitability, mitigate risks, and enhance overall 
operational efficiency.
